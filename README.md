# Active-Directory
Excited to share a recent project I completed, showcasing my skills in Windows Server and network administration!

On a virtual machine, I configured both Windows Server and Windows operating system on two separate machines:

1. **Domain Controller with Active Directory:** 
   - Set up the first machine as a domain controller.
   - Created Active Directory to manage users and resources efficiently.
   - Configured two network adapters: one for internet connectivity and another for the internal private client network.

2. **Network and IP Configuration:**
   - Assigned internal IP addresses.
   - Configured NAT and RAS to enable internal clients to access the internet through the domain controller.

3. **DHCP Configuration:**
   - Enabled DHCP so internal clients receive IP addresses automatically when connecting to the domain.

4. **Advanced Management:**
   - Created organizational units and group policies to streamline administrative tasks.
   - Enabled remote access to machines for seamless management.
   - Deployed software using PDQ, ensuring quick and efficient software distribution across the network.

This project has been a fantastic learning experience, deepening my understanding of network infrastructure and server management. Looking forward to applying these skills in future projects and continuing to grow in the field of IT and network administration! üíªüåê
